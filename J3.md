## 1. Define polymorphism in the context of Java and provide one example where it is valuable?
A situation where a variable that is declared something at compile time can be declared FINISH. 
A varibale is polymorphic when the run time time is different then the compile time time. 

## 2. Consider the following program from the class notes. Explain how polymorphism makes this program possible.
Because u is a polymorphic variable, the code that actually gets called the toString at runtime is dyamically bound based on the runtime type. 

## 3. What is the output of this program? You should be able to do this without running the program!
The output would be "A". 
--> D.toString where D is a reference, at runtime it will call toString, then go the super toString, basically saying 
D extends C and C extends A, therefore "A" is outputted. 

## 4. What is the output of this program? You should be able to do this without running the program!
The output would be "~~B~~ ~~B~~" . 

## 5. What is the output of this program? You should be able to do this without running the program!
The output would be "A A". 

## 6. Consider the first two class declarations. What is the output of compiling the program below?

## 7. If we change the implementation of A to the following, what does the code below output?

## 8. What is the output of this program? You should do this without running the program.

## 9. What is the output of the following snippet of code? If there is an ERROR, describe the error. You should not need to run the code to determine the output.
