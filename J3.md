## 1. Define polymorphism in the context of Java and provide one example where it is valuable?
A situation where a variable that is declared something at compile time can be declared FINISH. 
A varibale is polymorphic when the run time time is different then the compile time time. 

## 2. Consider the following program from the class notes. Explain how polymorphism makes this program possible.
Because u is a polymorphic variable, the code that actually gets called the toString at runtime is dyamically bound based on the runtime type. 

## 3. What is the output of this program? You should be able to do this without running the program!
The output would be "A". 
--> D.toString where D is a reference, at runtime it will call toString, then go the super toString, basically saying 
D extends C and C extends A, therefore "A" is outputted. 

## 4. What is the output of this program? You should be able to do this without running the program!
The output would be "~ ~ B ~ ~ ~ ~ B ~ ~" . 

## 5. What is the output of this program? You should be able to do this without running the program!
The output would be "A A". 

## 6. Consider the first two class declarations. What is the output of compiling the program below?
The code will actually have an error and will fail to produce an output because of the declaration of get_name() in class A. The private declaration of get_name is restrivtive than get_name in Letter, which was protected. 

## 7. If we change the implementation of A to the following, what does the code below output?
The code will still error out because the get_name() method in class A is once again given more restricted access than get_name() in Letter, which was public. 

## 8. What is the output of this program? You should do this without running the program.
"foo 1: B B"

## 9. What is the output of the following snippet of code? If there is an ERROR, describe the error. You should not need to run the code to determine the output.
Name: fluffy
Species: Canis Familiaris (pomeranian)
Name: george
Species: Canis Familiaris 
Name: brutus
Species: Felis Catus (shorthair)

## 10. For each of the following method calls marked below, indicate the value of the output, if the output cannot be determined, or if there is an error.
the output it 41.
multiple method calls, multiple print statements!!!!
A.1: 42
A.2: 50
A.3: error

B.1: 41
B.2: 49
B.3: y

D.1: 42
D.2: 7
D.3: error 


## 11. What is the difference between a class and an abstract class? From a software engineering perspective, why would you ever want to use an abstract class instead of a regular class?
You can never call an abstract class constuctor directly, you can only call super. And you can have abstract methods. 

## 12. If you were to create an abstract class for a Car â€“ what features could be defined in the implemented class vs. what could be defined in the abstract class? Provide justifications for your design.
In the implemented
